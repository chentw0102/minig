"Sanctified"

It's still getting worse after everything I've tried.
What if I found a way to wash it all aside.
What if she touches with those fingertips,
As the words spill out like fire from her lips?

[Chorus:]
And if she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all I'll give everything to her.
I am justified. I am purified. I am sanctified. Inside you

Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel.
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell (bitch).
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed.
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist

[Chorus]

I'm still caught up in another of her spells.
Well she's turning me into someone else.
Everyday I hope and pray this will end.
But when I can I do it all again

[Chorus]

As surely as the blade's course is run.
Maybe my kingdom's finally come.
